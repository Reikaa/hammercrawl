# Extend Your Dungeon Crawl

It's a common occurrence, you know: designers house-ruling the games that they themselves wrote. It happens so often that when you play a demo game run by that game's designer, nine times out of ten you're playing with their own unpublished house rules already. What makes it even funnier in this case is that HAMMERCRAWL! itself is really just my own assembled house rules for *other* games as it is. House rules for house rules, when will the madness end?!

This document contains my own extended "house rules" for the core HAMMERCRAWL! game engine. Some of these *could* have been considered basic enough to include in the core document, but in the spirit of keeping that game more or less "classic" in feel, I moved them here instead.

What you'll find within:
